FAQs
========

I am new to GitHub and Open Source. Where should I start?
-----------------------

Read the `Contributing Guide <https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md/>`_. It teaches you how to update docentation and/or source code by creating pull requests on GitHub. You can also find more information about the MIT License `here <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_.

What do I need to know to contribute to the codebase?
-----------------------
Sportsipy runs on Python 3 with some HTML. If you're interested in contributing to the codebase, you will need some familiarity with Python as well as some of the basic packages like Pandas, Numpy, Requests, etc.

How can I report a new bug?
-----------------------

Go ahead and create a new GitHub issue. Be sure to include as much information as possible so I can review and reproduce the bug.

Please note that these GitHub issues are for codebase-related issues and discussions – not for getting help with learning to code.

I am a student. Can I work on a feature for academic credits?
-----------------------

Yes. Please note I am unable to commit to any timelines or paperwork that may be a requirement by your college or university. I receive many pull-requests and code contributions from volunteer developers, and I respect their time and efforts. Out of respect for all of our other contributors, I will not give any PR special priority just because it happens to be school-related.

We request you to plan ahead and work on code contributions with this in mind.

I found a typo. Should I report an issue before I can make a pull request?
-----------------------

For typos and other wording changes, you can directly open pull requests without creating an issue first. Please be sure to mention details in the pull request description to help us understand and review your contribution – even if it's just a minor change.

Please do create an issue if you want to discuss bigger aspects of the codebase or curriculum.

It says this project is no longer undergoing active development! Does that mean no one can contribute anymore?
-----------------------

This project is no longer undergoing active development, but you can still submit pull requests. I frequently review them and if approved, I will merge them accordingly. Your contributions can still get added after all.

What do these different labels that are tagged on issues mean?
-----------------------

The code maintains `triage <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#Bug_management>`_ issues and pull requests based on their priority, severity, and other factors. You can `find a complete glossary of their meanings here <https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy/labels>`_.

Where do I start if I want to work on or submit an issue?
-----------------------

You should go through ``help wanted`` and ``good first issue`` issues for a 
quick overview of what is available for you to work on.
..
  [!TIP] ``help wanted`` issues are those where extra attention is needed
  and no permission is required to work on them.
  However, issues with the ``good first issue`` label are good for
  newcomers who have not contributed to Sportsipy before.

How do I report a security issue? What about all other complaints?
-----------------------
Instances of abusive, harassing, security violations or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at robdclark@outlook.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
